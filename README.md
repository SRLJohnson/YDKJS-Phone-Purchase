You Don't Know JS - Practice Exercise 1

Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones until you run out of money in your bank account. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold. 

After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in tax, then print out your calculated purchase amount, properly formated. 

Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
